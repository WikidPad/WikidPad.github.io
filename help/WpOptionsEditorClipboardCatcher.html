<ul><b>Application settings: Editor, clipboard catcher</b>    <br />
This page is only visible on Windows.<hr size="1" />
</ul>
&bull; <b>Prepend before clipboard snippet</b><br />
Control what the Clipboard Catcher should prepend before each caught snippet. This option supports time formats (as these shown in "Set Date Format" dialog in "Editor" menu)<br />
<br />
&bull; <b>Append after clipboard snippet</b><br />
Control what the Clipboard Catcher should append after each caught snippet. This option supports time formats (as these shown in "Set Date Format" dialog in "Editor" menu). The same escapes can be used as in the replace field of the "Find and Replace" dialog in regular expression mode.<br />
<br />
&bull; <b>Avoid doubled snippets</b><br />
If the same text is pasted multiple times consecutively to the clipboard, it is pasted only the first time. Some applications execute a single paste command as multiple pastes to the clipboard which would lead to multiple inserts without this option.<br />
<br />
&bull; <b>User notification</b><br />
Choose if you want to hear a sound when a clipboard snippet is inserted.<br />
<br />
&bull; <b>Sound file</b><br />
Choose the sound file to play (if you have chosen to be notified by sound above). If the field is empty, a default sound is played.    </body>
