Each wiki can have a "file store", where you can collect all the images, documents and other files, that are related to the wiki in one place. The wiki file store is formed by the "files" folder in the <span class="wiki-link"><a href="WikiFiles.html">wiki's directory</a></span>. Wikidpad offers some special facilities, to help maintain the file store, with respect to relative links and export to html.<br />
<br />
Files can of course be copied into the file store by hand; if the "files" folder does not yet exist, you have to create it first. Files can however also be copied, by dragging one or more of them from Windows Explorer onto the editor, while holding down the control key. The files are then copied to the file store and relative links to them are created in the editor. If a file with the same identity already exists in the store, only the link is created and no copying is performed. If a file with the same name, but a different identity already exists, a random sequence of 10 digits is appended to the file name, in order to make it unique. If the "files" folder does not yet exist, Wikidpad will create it.<br />
<br />
