&bull; <b>Result list"</b><br />
Below is a screenshot of part of a result list, with the results for two pages:<ul><img src="files/FullSearchExample1.png" alt="" border="0" /><br />
</ul>
Each item in the list consists of:<ul><li />a blue clickable bar, functioning as the "next occurence" button<li />the page name<li />in parentheses: the current occurence on the page and the number of occurences on the page separated by a slash&nbsp;"/".<br />
<ul><li />if the option "count occurences" is set to false, the number of occurences is represented by a questionmark&nbsp;"?".<br />
</ul>
<li />on the next line(s): a portion of the found text with the pattern<br />
<ul><li />the size of the portion depends on the setting of the "Context characters..." option.<br />
<br />
</ul>
</ul>
When there are more then one occurences in a page, you can skip through them by:<ul><li />clicking the blue bar.<li />selecting the page item in the list and pressing F3.</ul>
The item in the list is updated to show what the current occurence is.<br />
<br />
Double clicking on an item - outside the blue bar! - brings you to the page and the matching occurrence shown for it in the list item. If the page was already loaded, a double click brings you to the next occurrence on the page.    </body>
