Mar. 28, 2007 (1.9beta3, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 111)<br />
<pre>    * Autocompletion support for todo items and anchor fragments.
      See AutoCompletion.
    * HTML exporter now creates links which only contain anchor
      ("#somewhere") if linking to the same page.
    * Pagewide and wikiwide searches support now a history (not
      saved between sessions)
    * For "Replace All" operations the number of replacements is
      given at the end of operation.

    * Support for folding, includes storing of fold settings
      between sessions. See [Folding].
    * HTML entities like e.g. &amp;nbsp; are handled now.
      See TextFormatting!html.
    * System-wide hotkey to show/hide WikidPad (probably Windows
      only). Hotkeys are possible to be bound to the app and/or
      a particular wiki. See OptionsDialog#*App-bound# hotkey*
    * Option to offer closing bracket for bracketed wiki words
      on autocompletion.
      See OptionsDialog#*Append# closing# bracket# on# auto-complete*
    * Option to play a sound each time clipboard catcher caught
      text. See OptionsDialog#++++# Clipboard# catcher
    * New menu items in system tray menu to control clipboard
      catcher (for Windows).
    * New pages found during rebuild (for Original ... db types)
      get the modification date of the .wiki file.

    * Bug fixed (at least for Windows 2K/XP): Wiki words with
      foreign characters were not recognized or recognized with
      wrong characters after rebuild of wikis with "Original ..."
      types.
    * Bug fixed: After rebuild of a database, wikiwords were no
      longer recognized as existing (restart was needed).
    * Bug (probably) fixed: Attribute \[child_sort_order: natural]
      didn't always work properly.
    * Bugs fixed: Some Linux quirks, but enough remaining yet.

    * Internal: Changed wxPython namespace use from the
      old-fashioned (wxFrame) to the "wx" namespace (wx.Frame).
      There may be bugs yet.</pre>

      open database" appeared under some circumstances.
