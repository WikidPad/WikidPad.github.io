<pre>    * "toc" insertion for a page-wide table of contents (with
      appropriate settings in the CSS-file(s)). See [Insertions].
    * "noerror" appendix for insertions for external graphical apps
      (except MimeTeX) to ignore warning/error messages.
      See ExternalGraphicalApplications.
    * For Windows: Option to use Internet Explorer or
      (with restrictions) Mozilla to render HTML preview
      (including a new style sheet to control preview).
      See [Options HTML preview_export]#*Preview# renderer*
    * Option to set doctype for HTML preview/export.
    * Option to set background color of selected text.
    * Internal: Slightly better handling of databases without
      write access.
    * Further small changes in incremental search.
    * Bug fixed: External graphical apps didn't work if path
      to them contained space(s).</pre>

<a name=".h1025"></a><h3>1.8 beta 5</h3>
Nov. 24, 2006 (1.8beta5, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 99)<br />
<pre>    * Changed insertion syntax where value or appendices can
      be quoted to include arbitrary characters. See [Insertions].
    * Plugins for accessing MimeTeX, Ploticus and GraphViz
      applications via Insertions.
      See [ExternalGraphicalApplications].
    
    * Tags to mark text as suppressed (&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;) are no longer shown
      in HTML preview/export
    * "Wiki Info" dialog to show some basic information about the
      current wiki. Rather empty at the moment.
    * New behavior and look of incremental search. May change again
      if users don't like it.
    * Renaming links to a page when renaming the page now only
      renames whole words.

    * Windows binary installer: .wiki file of WikidPadHelp are now
      always overwritten on updating.

    * Internal: Plugin type "InsertionByKey" created which registers
      special insertion keys to be handled by a plugin
    * Internal: Plugin type "Options" created which allows to
      register additional options (to be saved in config files) and
      to add related pages in the options dialog.</pre>

<a name=".h2217"></a><h3>1.8 beta 4</h3>
Oct. 30, 2006 (1.8beta4, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 96)<br />
<pre>    * Menu items and toolbar icons for zoom in/out also work for
      preview now.
    * Better page search. Search starts at cursor position or
      optional at beginning. Before wrapping search from page end
      to beginning, user is asked.
    * Bug fixed: Showing (more precisely searching) of words in
      subcategories of todos in tree did not work.
    * Bug fixed: Zooming preview didn't show up dynamically.</pre>

<a name=".h2754"></a><h3>1.8 beta 3</h3>
Oct. 26, 2006 (1.8beta3, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 95)<br />
<pre>    * List undefined pages (dead wiki links), also appropriate
      insertion added. See WikiMaintenance!finding_undefined_links,
      [Insertions]
    * Better alphabetical sort order for wiki words, todos,
      attributes in tree. See OptionsDialog#*Sort# order*
    * The order how wiki pages are ordered when printing or
      exporting the whole wiki or a subtree to a single HTML page
      is (hopefully) more logical. It is the same as the new
      "As Tree" order used in PageListDialog#"As# Tree" .
    * Option to generate a table of contents in tree or list form
      for HTML exports, see WikiExport#*Additional# options* ,
      [Options HTML preview_export]#*Table# of# contents*
    
    * Bug fixed: Detection of Linux OS failed due to a typo
    * Bug fixed: Pages were shown as parentless even if an alias
      of the page had a parent
    * Bug fixed: Opening a particular page on startup by mentioning
      the .wiki file on commandline did not work
    * Bug fixed: Special URLs containing $ couldn't be activated
      (further fixes may be necessary)
    * Bug fixed: Bad HTML code if first cell of a table row is empty
      and indented.</pre>

      wiki configuration file failed.</pre>

<a name=".h4823"></a><h3>1.8 beta 1</h3>
Aug. 30, 2006 (1.8beta1, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 89)<br />
<pre>Changes:
    * New database format! After updating a wiki it won't be
      readable anymore for older versions of WikidPad.
    * Updating of wiki databases to new versions is now done only
      after asking user.
    * New position for configuration files on Windows inside
      "Application Data\WikidPad" directory. You might have to move
      "WikidPad.config" file and ".WikidPadGlobals" directory from
      "Application Data" to the new location if updating from
      a previous version. Name of "Application Data" directory
      depends on OS language.
    
    * Cursor and scroll position are now saved between sessions.
    * Possibility to set size and alignment for image URLs.
      See UrlLinking#++# URL# Appendix
    * Functional pages for "camelcase blacklist". Words on this
      list are not shown as wiki links. See WordLinking
    * Option to automatically remove bullets and numbers which
      stand "lonely" on a line by pressing enter.
      See BulletedLists
    
    * Menu functions "Show Tree Control", "Show Toolbar" and
      "Stay on Top" moved to "View" menu
    * Preview now shows indented paragraphs correctly (or,
      at least, better)
    
    * Bug fixed: Wiki word aliases not shown as links on
      HTML export.
    * Bug fixed: Wrong URL creation mode when releasing/pressing
      SHIFT or CTRL during drag&amp;drop operation.
    * Better handling of non Western-European languages on
      Win 98/ME</pre>
