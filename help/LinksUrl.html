<a name=".h48"></a><h3>General</h3>
To create a link to an external item, the default HTML URL can be used, with the format:<ul><li />scheme://host.domain:port/path/filename <a href="#.f1">[1]</a>.</ul>
Wikidpad supports the general <span class="wiki-link"><a href="LinksUrlSchemes.html">schemes</a></span>: http, https, ftp, mailto, outlook and file <a href="#.f2">[2]</a>. This means that those links can be defined, by simply typing or pasting them into your page; example:<ul><li /><span class="url-link"><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_url.asp">http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_url.asp</a></span></ul>
Wikidpad supports two further links types of it's own, that are shaped as separate schemes:<ul><li />wiki: used for linking to other (wikidpad) wiki's; see also <span class="wiki-link"><a href="LinksWikis.html">External links: Wiki's</a></span>.<li />rel: to make linking with relative path's possible; see <span class="wiki-link"><a href="#RelPaths">Relative paths</a></span> below.</ul>
Due to it's nature, Wikidpad cannot use relative paths until a page is exported/published to HTML. The reason for this, is that during preview it's not the wiki folder, that is the "home" folder, but the Wikidpad program folder or the temp folder. <a href="#.f3">[3]</a><br />
<br />
A absolute file URL can be quickly created, by using the menu item: "Editor / Add file URL"<br />
<br />
<a href="#">Top</a><hr size="1" />
<a name=".h1117"></a><h3>Link titles</h3>
<a name=".h1133"></a><h4>As text</h4>
As in a standard HTML page, a link text can - in preview and HTML export - be replaced by a link title, that then serves as a clickable synonym for the link. For that the link has to be enclosed in square brackets and the link and title text have to be separated by a "|" character. Example:<ul><li /> <span class="url-link"><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_url.asp">W3 Schools: URL's</a></span><br />
<hr size="1" />
</ul>
<a name=".h1519"></a><h4>As images</h4>
As in a standard HTML page, a link text can - in preview and HTML export - be replaced by an image, that then serves as a clickable synonym for the link. For that the link has to be enclosed in square brackets and the link and the image specification have to be separated by vertical bar "|". Example:<ul><li /> <span class="url-link"><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_url.asp"><img src="files/w3schools.gif" alt="" border="0" align="middle" /></a></span>   W3 Schools: URL's</ul>
The image specification has the general form of a URL, with the possibility to add image formatting attributes; see <span class="wiki-link"><a href="TextImages.html">Textformatting: Images</a></span> for more information on specifying image links.<br />

<a name=".f2"></a>[2] <i>Scheme is sometimes also referred to as "protocol"</i><br />
<a name=".f3"></a>[3] <i>This means that you can also not use relative paths within html elements, like in the src="..." attribute for an image element. In order for them to show up in preview correctly, you háve to use absolute paths or a wikidpad rel link.</i><hr size="1" />
<a name=".h2548"></a><h3>Files</h3>
<a name="RelPaths"></a><a name=".h2574"></a><h4>Relative paths</h4>
In Wikidpad relative paths can't be used, the way they can in regular html. The way to do it in Wikidpad, is to use the "rel" scheme. This scheme has the format: "rel://" (without the backslash!) and is during preview replaced with the path to the folder of the active wiki. Html export turns it into a correct relative path reference. The rel scheme can be used both for file references and image references.<br />
<br />
The rel reference follows the rules for the html relative path specification; this means that:<br />
<ul><table border="2">
<tr><td>rel://filename.ext </td><td>refers to a file in the folder of the current wiki</td></tr>
<tr><td>rel://files/filename.ext </td><td>refers to a file in the "files" subfolder of the current wiki folder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>rel://../filename.ext </td><td>refers to a file in the folder above the current wiki folder in the file hiërarchie</td></tr>
</table>
<br />
</ul>
In a wiki that has been exported to html, the "home" or "root" folder is not the current wiki folder, but the export folder. As of version 19beta 17 wikidpad copies all files with relatives path's over to the export folder, with the correct folder structure.<br />
<br />
<b>Remarks</b><ul><li />A relative URL can easily be created, by draging it from Windows Explorer onto the editor, while holding down the shift key. This does however not work for files ending with ".wiki"; the created links for these files use the wiki scheme, that does not allow relative paths.<li />For those who are not realy into html and relative path declarations, a more comprehensive example can be <span class="wiki-link"><a href="FilesRelativePathsExamples.html">found here</a></span>.<li />For more information on URL links see <span class="wiki-link"><a href="#Top">Url links</a></span></ul>
<ul><hr size="1" />
</ul>
<a name=".h2632"></a><h4>File store</h4>
Each wiki can have a "file store", where you can collect all the images, documents and other files, that are related to the wiki in one place. The wiki file store is formed by the "files" folder in the <span class="wiki-link"><a href="WikiFiles.html">wiki's directory</a></span>. Wikidpad offers some special facilities, to help maintain the file store, with respect to relative links and export to html.<br />
<br />
Files can of course be copied into the file store by hand; if the "files" folder does not yet exist, you have to create it first. Files can however also be copied, by dragging one or more of them from Windows Explorer onto the editor, while holding down the control key. The files are then copied to the file store and relative links to them are created in the editor. If a file with the same identity already exists in the store, only the link is created and no copying is performed. If a file with the same name, but a different identity already exists, a random sequence of 10 digits is appended to the file name, in order to make it unique. If the "files" folder does not yet exist, Wikidpad will create it.<br />
<br />
For more information on how Wikidpad compares files and how you that can be influenced, see <span class="wiki-link"><a href="FilesWikiFileStore.html#CopyControl">Wiki File Store: Copy control</a></span><br />

<a name=".h2694"></a><h3>Settings</h3>
<a name=".h2707"></a><h4>Options</h4>
<ul><b>Application settings: File Launcher</b><br />
This option page is only visible on non-Windows systems.<hr size="1" />
</ul>
&bull; <b>Path to file launcher</b><br />
The path to the script or program that takes the path or URL of a file and runs the application associated with this file. For Linux this would be the "xdg-open" script; it might in some cases have to be installed first.<br />
<br />
On Windows and Linux, data files with a particular suffix can be associated with a particular application, so that the data file (e.g. "index.html") can be "executed" by starting the application with the file as parameter. On Windows this is a functionality of the OS itself while on Linux it is a functionality of the graphical environment like KDE or Gnome. To use this function there, a helper (normally the "xdg-open" script) must be called which detects the appropriate application and starts it.<br />
<br />
When (double)clicking a URL in WikidPad on Linux, the script is called with a file path (for "file:"/"rel:" URLs) or the URL itself as parameter.<br />
<ul><b>Application settings: Mouse, drag &amp; drop files</b><hr size="1" />
</ul>
&bull; <b>Dropping files</b><br />
&bull; <b>Dropping files with SHIFT</b><br />
&bull; <b>Dropping files with CTRL</b><br />
Control what should happen if you drag and drop files from explorer into the editor with no key pressed, with SHIFT pressed or with CTRL pressed.<br />
<br />
Possible choices are:<ul><li />Nothing<li />Absolute URL: Insert absolute URL(s) to the file(s)<li />Relative URL: URL(s) starting with "rel:"<li />Relative into storage: Copy file(s) into file storage and create relative URL(s) to it</ul>
