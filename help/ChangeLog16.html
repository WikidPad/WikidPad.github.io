<a name=".h53"></a><h3>1.6 beta 4</h3>
Feb. 24, 2006 (1.6beta4, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 60)<br />
<pre>Changes:
    * Commandline support for exporting (parts of) a wiki and
      deletion of personal configuration (see [CommandLineSupport])
    * Windows binary installer: Support for deleting config.
      files on uninstall
    * Support HTML tags in WikidPad

    * Support for wiki specific text blocks (see [TextBlocks])
    * Editing of text blocks files from within WikidPad as
      "functional pages", located under Views in tree
    * Editor font now changes instantly after saving page
    * Now at most one script is executed when pressing
      Ctrl-Number (search order: local page, imported scripts,
      global imported scripts page)

    * Better handling of property "camelCaseWordsEnabled" during
      database update/rebuild.
    * Gadfly database backend: Rebuild does no more loose
      creation and modification date of a page.


Fixed bugs:
    * Crash on non-ascii characters in path to wiki database
    * Refresh of text blocks menu didn't work
    * When word in tree node had no children but got one after
      update, no '+' icon appeared after refresh.
    * Problems with wiki-wide search and page search
    * Jumping to wiki word didn't work if cursor and word were
      at end of page.</pre>

<a name=".h1392"></a><h3>1.6 beta 3</h3>
Feb. 09, 2006 (1.6beta3, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 57)<br />
<pre>Changes:
    * 'global.import_scripts' property introduced (see
      [InlinePythonEval]) 
    * Security option to control if scripts should be executed
      and (global.)import_scripts property should be respected
      (see [InlinePythonEval]) 

    * 'template' property introduced to use content of one page
      as template for children of another page. (see
      [WikiDocumentAttributes]).

    * Hierarchical global presentation deduction: e.g. a property
      'global.work.color' will be applied to pages containing
      'work', "work.somewhere", "work.somewhere.else" ...
      properties, except there is e.g. a
      'global.work.somewhere.else.color' property. This works for
      'color', 'icon' and 'bold' properties which control the
      presentation of the tree nodes (see [WikiDocumentAttributes]).

    * Differential user_extensions: A file in "user_extensions"
      now only needs to contain the  definitions which are
      different compared to the file in "extensions"

    * In configuration directory, a directory ".WikidPadGlobals"
      will be created if not existing
    * In ".WikidPadGlobals" a file "[TextBlocks].wiki" will be
      created if not existing. This file describes content of
      the "Editor"-&gt;"Text blocks" submenu and can be customized
      (see [TextBlocks]).
    
    * Bug in autoNew.py script fixed
    * Bug with renaming in "compact_sqlite" database fixed</pre>

<a name=".h2928"></a><h3>1.6 beta 2</h3>
Jan. 25, 2006 (1.6beta2, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 55)<br />
<pre>*Warning*: This version has a new database format. It is converted
automatically when opening a wiki the first time. Making a backup
beforehand is therefore recommended!

Changes:
    * No more brackets around wiki words in the "Open Wiki Word"
      and all other dialogs
    * Characters can be escaped with backslash and are then
      interpreted as normal text (see [TextFormatting])
    * New dialog to choose which pages to search for, to export
      or to print (see [PageListDialog], [Printing], [WikiExport],
      [SearchingTheWiki])
    * New options to control the auto save timing
      (see [OptionsDialog])

    * Some bugs fixed</pre>

<a name=".h3689"></a><h3>1.6 beta 1</h3>
Jan. 13, 2006 (1.6beta1, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 53)<br />
<pre>Changes:
    * WikidPad and WikidPadCompact merged into one application
      (therefore the new version number) (see [DatabaseTypes])
    * In wiki-wide search cycling through found matching occurrences
      on a page with F3 or clicking on the little blue bar
    * Basic printing support (see [Printing])
    * Support for titled wiki words and URLs (e.g
      [http://www.somewhere.com/aaa/bbb |Somewhere]
      [ScratchPad |This text is shown in preview and HTML export] )
      The title of the link is not stored in the XML export!

    * Options to control timing behavior of syntax highlighter (see
      [OptionsDialog])
    * Option to set background color of text editor (works only
      partially)

    * Bug fixed: non camel-case words starting with camel-case word
      (e.g. [WikiWord with something]) incorrectly recognized in tree</pre>
